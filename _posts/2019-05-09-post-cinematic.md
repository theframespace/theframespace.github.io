Filme ➡︎ television as “cultural dominant” in the mid-twentieth century ➡︎ computer based and digitally generated “new media”

Film itself has not disappeared but has been transformed from an analog process to a heavily digitised one. 

Brian Massumi (2002, 23-45) in differentiating between affect and emotion. For Massumi, **affect** is primary, non-conscious, asubjective or presubjective, asignifying, unqualified, and intensive; while **emotion** is derivative, conscious, qualified, and meaningful, a “content” that can be attributed to an already-constituted subject.

신자유주의에서는 neoliberalism 푸코에 따르면 Homo oeconomicus 를 스스로 기업가라고 여기며, 그들 스스로 프로듀서, capital 그리고 그들스스로를 그 자신의 수입원으로 여긴다라고 해였다. “Homo oeconomicus as entrepreneur of himself, being for himself his own capital, being for himself his own producer, being for himself the source of his earnings” (2008, 226).” 이러한 환경에서 감정/정서는 투자해야할 자원이며 더 큰 수입을 기대할 수 있는 것이다. 

## post-Fordist society 

> @ Shaviro@ In the control society, or in the post-Fordist information economy, forms can be changed at will to meet the needs of the immediate situation. The only fixed requirement is precisely to maintain an underlying flexibility: **an ability to take on any shape as needed**, a capacity to adapt quickly and smoothly to the demands of any form, or any procedure, whatsoever

### Flexibility and Modulation

> “must be “adaptible and flexible, able to switch from one situation to a very different one, and adjust to it; and versatile, capable of changing activity or tools, depending on the nature of the relationship entered into with others or with objects” (Boltanski and Chiapello 2007, 112).”

> Deleuze says that, where the older mechanisms of confinement, foregrounded in Foucault's disciplinary society, are analogical, in the emerging control society, with its continual modulations, "the various forms of control. . . are inseparable variations, forming a system of varying geometry whose language is digital" (Deleuze 1995, 178).

###  David Harvey’s space
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgMn2OJmx3w]
Actually, Harvey describes three conceptions of space. 

1. The first is the absolute space of **ordinary perception**; this is Cartesian­ Newtonian space. 
2. The second is the **relative space of Einstein and modern physics**. 
3. Relational space is the third. 

Harvey emphasizes that it is not a question of determining which of these three , would be the "true" concept of space, but of understanding how "space can become one or all simultaneously depending upon the circumstances. The problem of the proper conceptualisation of space is resolved through human practice with respect to it" (Harvey 2006, 125-126) . 

> “David Harvey. As Harvey describes it, “the relational view of space holds that there is no such thing as space or time outside of the processes that define them… Processes do not occur in space but define their own spatial frame. The concept of space is embedded in or internal to process” (Harvey 2006, 123)”

### Rodowick

“nothing moves, nothing endures in a digitally composed world… in digital cinema there is no longer continuity in space and movement, but only montage or combination” (Rodowick 2007,171-173). 

Where classical cinema was analogical and indexical, digital video is processual and combinatorial. Where analog cinema was about the duration of bodies and images, digital video is about the articulation and composition of forces. And where cinema was an art of individuated presences, digital video is an art of what Deleuze calls the dividual: a condition in which identities are continually being decomposed and recomposed, on multiple levels, through the modulation of numerous independent parameters (Deleuze 1995, 180, 182).16”

### Bazinian realism and Contemporary realism

The very opposition between reality based and image-based modes of presentation breaks down in the contemporary world of electronic media and global capital. **Today, the most vivid and intense reality is precisely the reality of images.**  
> Those images “require participation in depth” (McLuhan 1994, 31)”

**Assayas** can express his faith in reality. It is only through a delirious aestheticism, and by embracing the artifice of images and sounds, that his movies are able to “relate physically with an audience,” and thereby actualise their extreme abstractions. Such a “relationship to physicality,” 
> Assayas says, is “what is missing today from arthouse cinema” – although horror films have it in abundance (Hillis 2008).”

**Vivian Sobchack** compellingly argues, for instance, that _electronic media “engage their spectators and ‘users’ in a phenomenological structure of sensual and psychological experience that, in comparison with the cinematic,_ seems so diffused as to belong to no-body... the electronic is phenomenologically experienced not as a discrete, intentional, body-centered mediation and projection in space but rather as a simultaneous, dispersed, and insubstantial transmission across a network or web that is constituted spatially more as a materially flimsy latticework of nodal points than as the stable ground of embodied experience” (Sobchack 2004, 152, 154). ”

### Marc Augé’s nonplaces
신체가 지워지고 인간성이 지워지는 그러한 장요 

> “a world where people are born in the clinic and die in hospital, where transit points and temporary abodes are proliferating under luxurious or inhuman conditions... where a dense network of means of transport which are also inhabited spaces is developing; where the habitué of supermarkets, slot machines and credit cards communicates wordlessly, through gestures, with an abstract, unmediated commerce” (Augé 1995, 78)”
